## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/spywithcode/myAi.git](repository)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv envAi
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Additional setup steps:**
    - **Download pre-trained AI model weights:**  
      Download the required model files from [model link] and place them in the `models/` directory.
    - **Set up API keys:**  
      Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys, for example:
      ```
      SPEECH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
      ```
    - **Configure smart home integrations (optional):**  
      Edit the `config.yaml` file to add your smart home device credentials.
    - **Check microphone permissions:**  
      Ensure your system allows microphone access for the browser or application.

## üí° Usage

Follow these steps to use Shree AI:

1. **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
    ```bash
    source envAi/bin/activate  # On Windows: envAi\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Run the main application** (for example, a web app):
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. **Access the interface:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or the address shown in your terminal).

4. **Give voice commands:**
   - Use your microphone to speak commands as prompted by the interface.
   - Example commands:  
     - "Open browser"  
     - "Set alarm"  
     - "Play music"  
     - "Language Converter"

5. **Customize settings:**
   - Navigate to the settings or profile section to adjust language, voice profile, or smart home integrations.

6. **For help or troubleshooting:**
   - Refer to the help section in the interface or check the logs/output in your terminal.

*Note: Replace `app.py` and URLs with your actual entry point and interface details if different.*
